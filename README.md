# Interactive Form

In this project, I used JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional conference called "FullStack Conf."

Using the supplied HTML and CSS files, I added my own JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by:

- Adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity.
- Validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.

Instead of plain "vanilla" JavaScript, I used the popular jQuery library to complete this project.

The benefits of using jQuery are:

- Shorter and simplified syntax.
- Help with cross-browser compatibility since jQuery deals with a lot of that stuff under the hood.
